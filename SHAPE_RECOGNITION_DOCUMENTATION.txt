================================================================================
1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The AI Shape Recognition System is a comprehensive machine learning solution
that automatically converts hand-drawn sketches into perfect geometric shapes
in real-time. It combines deep learning with geometric analysis to provide
robust shape recognition capabilities.

Key Features:
- Real-time shape recognition using TensorFlow.js
- Supports 5 shape types: line, circle, rectangle, triangle, freehand
- Dual recognition system: AI model + geometric fallback
- Browser-based processing (no server required)
- Learning capability from user feedback
- Multi-user synchronization via WebSocket

================================================================================
2. CLASS STRUCTURE & INITIALIZATION
================================================================================

class AIShapeRecognition {
  constructor() {
    this.model = null;                    // TensorFlow.js model instance
    this.isModelLoaded = false;           // Model loading status
    this.shapeClasses = [                 // 5 shape categories
      'line', 'circle', 'rectangle', 'triangle', 'freehand'
    ];
    this.inputSize = 64;                  // 64x64 pixel bitmap size
  }
}

Key Design Decisions:
- 5 Shape Classes: Covers most common geometric shapes
- 64x64 Bitmap: Balance between detail and performance
- Singleton Pattern: One instance manages all recognition

Initialization Process:
1. Create neural network model
2. Compile with optimizer and loss function
3. Load pre-trained weights (if available)
4. Set model as ready for inference

================================================================================
3. NEURAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

================================================================================
4. DATA PREPROCESSING PIPELINE
================================================================================

Step 1: Point Normalization
---------------------------
Purpose: Makes recognition size-invariant and position-independent

Process:
1. Calculate bounding box of the drawing
   - minX, maxX, minY, maxY from all points
2. Calculate width and height
   - width = maxX - minX
   - height = maxY - minY
3. Normalize each point to 0-1 range
   - normalizedX = (pointX - minX) / width
   - normalizedY = (pointY - minY) / height

Benefits:
- Size invariance: Large and small drawings treated equally
- Position invariance: Drawing location doesn't affect recognition
- Consistent input: All drawings fit in [0,1] x [0,1] space

Step 2: Bitmap Creation (64x64)
-------------------------------
Purpose: Convert vector drawing to raster image for neural network

Process:
1. Create empty 64x64 bitmap (4,096 pixels)
2. Use Bresenham's line algorithm to draw stroke
3. Set pixels to 1 where stroke exists, 0 elsewhere
4. Flatten to 1D array for neural network input

Bresenham's Line Algorithm:
- Efficient line drawing algorithm
- Ensures smooth, connected strokes
- Handles all line orientations correctly
- Minimal computational overhead

Bitmap Benefits:
- Neural networks excel at image recognition
- Captures spatial relationships between points
- Handles complex stroke patterns
- Standardized input format

Step 3: Feature Combination
---------------------------
Final input vector: [7 geometric features] + [4,096 pixel values] = 4,103 features

================================================================================
5. FEATURE EXTRACTION (7 GEOMETRIC FEATURES)
================================================================================

The system extracts 7 key geometric features that help distinguish between
different shape types:

1. Aspect Ratio
   - Formula: width / height
   - Purpose: Distinguishes lines (high ratio) from squares (low ratio)
   - Range: 0 to infinity
   - Example: Line = 5.0, Square = 1.0, Circle = 1.0

2. Compactness
   - Formula: area / (pathLength²)
   - Purpose: Measures how "tight" the shape is
   - Range: 0 to 1
   - Example: Circle = 0.25, Line = 0.0, Rectangle = 0.1

3. Straightness
   - Formula: pathLength / straightLineDistance
   - Purpose: Measures how straight the path is
   - Range: 1.0 to infinity
   - Example: Perfect line = 1.0, Curved line = 1.5

4. Direction Change Rate
   - Formula: directionChanges / totalPoints
   - Purpose: Measures how often the drawing changes direction
   - Range: 0 to 1
   - Example: Line = 0.0, Circle = 0.8, Rectangle = 0.2

5. Average Curvature
   - Formula: totalCurvature / totalPoints
   - Purpose: Measures overall curvature of the path
   - Range: 0 to π
   - Example: Line = 0.0, Circle = 0.5, Rectangle = 0.1

6. Closure Detection
   - Formula: startEndDistance < min(width, height) * 0.3
   - Purpose: Determines if shape is closed
   - Range: 0 or 1
   - Example: Line = 0, Circle = 1, Rectangle = 1

7. Point Density
   - Formula: totalPoints / pathLength
   - Purpose: Measures drawing detail level
   - Range: 0 to infinity
   - Example: Rough drawing = 0.5, Detailed = 2.0

Feature Normalization:
All features are divided by 100 before input to neural network for stability.

================================================================================
6. NEURAL NETWORK PREDICTION
================================================================================

Input Preparation:
1. Combine bitmap (4,096 values) + features (7 values) = 4,103 total
2. Normalize all values by dividing by 100
3. Create TensorFlow tensor with shape [1, 4103]

Prediction Process:
1. Forward pass through neural network
2. Get probability distribution for all 5 classes
3. Find class with highest probability
4. Return shape type and confidence score

Output Interpretation:
- Probabilities: Array of 5 values, sum = 1.0
- Max Index: Index of highest probability (0-4)
- Confidence: Probability of predicted class (0.0-1.0)
- Shape Type: String name from shapeClasses array

Example Output:
probabilities = [0.1, 0.8, 0.05, 0.03, 0.02]  // [line, circle, rect, tri, freehand]
maxIndex = 1
confidence = 0.8
shapeType = 'circle'

Memory Management:
- Always dispose tensors to prevent memory leaks
- inputTensor.dispose()
- prediction.dispose()

================================================================================
7. FALLBACK RECOGNITION SYSTEM
================================================================================

When AI model confidence < 30%, system uses geometric heuristics:

Line Detection:
- Condition: !isClosed && aspectRatio > 3 && straightness < 1.5
- Confidence: 0.8
- Logic: Not closed, very long and thin, relatively straight

Circle Detection:
- Condition: isClosed && |width - height| < min(width, height) * 0.3
- Confidence: 0.7
- Logic: Closed shape, roughly square (width ≈ height)

Rectangle Detection:
- Condition: isClosed && aspectRatio < 2
- Confidence: 0.6
- Logic: Closed shape, reasonable aspect ratio

Fallback Benefits:
- Works even when AI model fails
- Provides reliable geometric analysis
- Lower confidence but still useful
- Ensures system always has some recognition capability

================================================================================
8. SHAPE CONVERSION
================================================================================

Once a shape is recognized, it's converted to perfect geometric form:

Line Conversion:
- Start Point: (minX, minY) - top-left of bounding box
- End Point: (maxX, maxY) - bottom-right of bounding box
- Result: Perfect straight line between corners

Circle Conversion:
- Center: (centerX, centerY) - center of bounding box
- Radius: min(width, height) / 2 - half of smaller dimension
- Result: Perfect circle fitting the bounding box

Rectangle Conversion:
- Position: (minX, minY) - top-left corner
- Dimensions: width × height - exact bounding box
- Result: Perfect rectangle matching the drawn shape

Triangle Conversion:
- Currently uses bounding box approximation
- Future: Could implement more sophisticated triangle detection

Conversion Benefits:
- Replaces rough sketches with perfect shapes
- Maintains original color and stroke width
- Preserves shape ID for synchronization
- Improves visual quality of drawings

================================================================================
9. INTEGRATION WITH WHITEBOARD
================================================================================

Recognition Trigger:
- Activated on mouse up event (drawing completion)
- Minimum 5 points required for recognition
- Only processes if shape recognition is enabled

Process Flow:
1. User finishes drawing (mouse up)
2. Check if recognition is enabled and enough points exist
3. Call aiShapeRecognition.recognizeShape()
4. If confidence > 50%, replace freehand with perfect shape
5. Update elements array with new shape
6. Emit shape recognition event to other users
7. Update debug info with recognition result

Real-time Synchronization:
- Uses WebSocket events to sync recognized shapes
- Event: SHAPE_RECOGNIZED
- Payload: { roomId, elementId, shape }
- All connected users receive the perfect shape

Visual Feedback:
- Debug info shows recognition status
- AI toggle button shows model status
- Confidence percentage displayed
- Shape type confirmation
